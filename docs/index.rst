matplotlib-napari
=================
``matplotlib-napari`` is a ``napari`` plugin for generating ``Matplotlib`` plots
from one or more ``napari`` Layers.

Design
------
``matplotlib-napari`` contains a number of different ``napari`` widgets. Each
widget is designed to map one or more ``napari`` Layers on to a ``Matplotlib``
plot. As an example, the `~.HistogramWidget` is used to
map one or more Image layers on to a 1D histogram plot.
